Multiple video feed transmission with efficient image compression and reproduction was the primary objective of this application.  The format of streaming data has been found far from ideal as the bandwidth required is higher than popular coding techniques like MPEG2 or H.264. Using GZIP algorithm the data is compressed to fit into a reasonable data transfer range. It is then compressed further and encoded to Base64 since the data is being transferred via JSON objects using TCP.
